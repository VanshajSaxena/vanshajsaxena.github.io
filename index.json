I new use vim keybinding in everything that I do, from text editing to browsing the web.\nNeovim is highly configurable and extensible, this is one of its qualities among others. It is configured using a simple language called Lua.\nLua is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. It supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, data-driven programming, and data description.\nI started to learn Lua in my free time and became quite familiar with it very quickly. The language is so simple that it has only a single data structure, tables. A single data structure to rule them all.\nSince I first started using Neovim I maintained my own Neovim configuration, building it from scratch and rewriting it, several times. This was in itself a spiritual process in my programming journey.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the structure of my Neovim configuration:\nStructure nvim ├── hyperfine.out ├── init.lua ├── lazy-lock.json ├── lazyvim.json ├── LICENSE ├── lua │ ├── config │ │ ├── autocmds.lua │ │ ├── keymaps.lua │ │ ├── options.lua │ │ └── startup.lua │ └── plugins │ ├── coding.lua │ ├── colorscheme.lua │ ├── disabled.lua │ ├── editor.lua │ ├── extras.lua │ ├── lsp │ │ ├── core.lua │ │ └── utils.lua │ ├── overrides.lua │ ├── tools.lua │ └── ui.lua ├── spell │ ├── en.utf-8.add │ └── en.utf-8.add.spl └── stylua.toml This has evolved so much since I first started.\nI now have moved to using Neovim Distributions as they provide structured API through which I can extend further and save some time for other projects. Maintaining a Neovim configurable is sometimes so time taking that you get to have very little time for other projects that you work upon.\nHere is the source code for anyone interested in diving more deep into the Neovim Ecosystem.\n","permalink":"https://vanshaj.xyz/projects/neovim/","summary":"\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://neovim.io/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNeovim\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e is a hyperextensible modal text editor based\non Vim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started using Vim during the first year of my engineering and instantly knew\nit is an incredible tool.
