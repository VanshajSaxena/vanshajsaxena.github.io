&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-selection&#34;&gt;The Selection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day of January 29, 2024 I was selected for a semester wide program
powered by &lt;strong&gt;Infosys&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt; for iOS development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://vanshaj.xyz/posts/bootcamp/&#34;&gt;Bootcamp&lt;/a&gt; was a tremendous experience.
Out of around 900 students, 100 students were selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This marked a new beginning for my full-day college schedule, which I had been
following for the past 2 years. What was about to come proved even challenging
than what I had anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the last week of December 2024, I signed up for a Bootcamp at my college
designed to select students from the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)
branch for a semester-long program. This experience marked a new chapter in how
I would spend my time in college. I was eager to learn new concepts and gain
insights into industry standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week-long Bootcamp was an intense assessment of my knowledge across various
domains, and I genuinely enjoyed it. Additionally, I made some friends during
this time, and we still keep in touch today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
