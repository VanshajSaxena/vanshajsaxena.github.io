<p>My first team project was <strong>CareNote</strong>.</p>
<p>It was in intense journey to first come up
with a problem that has some meaning and is relevant to at least some people.
Then develop the actual solution that can solve <em>this real problem in the real
world</em>.</p>
<p>Before this I had always wrote small programs that only served me, mainly in
configuring my development experience in <a href="/projects/neovim/">Neovim</a>, which is a small project in itself maintained by me.</p>
<p>Here are some of the screenshots of the <strong>prototype</strong> which I with my teammates
designed.</p>

</div>

<hr>
<p>I could not provide the screenshots of the actual application as I do not own a
Mac or an iPhone (so I could build locally) and the few screenshots I took that
time have been lost unfortunately.</p>
<p>But you can have a look at the source code if you want to dive deep,
<a href="https://github.com/VanshajSaxena/CareNote">here</a>.</p>
<p>These are only the prototype screenshots, we were able to make similar UIs but
due being new to Swift and UIKit at that time it was a learning experience.</p>
